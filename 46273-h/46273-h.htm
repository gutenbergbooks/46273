<p class="noindent"><big>T</big>he little volumes in the <span class="smcap">Arts of
the Church</span> series are intended
to provide information in an interesting
as well as an accurate form about the
various arts which have clustered round
the public worship of <span class="smcap">God</span> in the Church
of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>. Though few have the opportunity
of knowing much about them,
there are many who would like to possess
the main outlines about those arts whose
productions are so familiar to the Christian,
and so dear. The authors will write
for the average intelligent man who has
not had the time to study all these matters
for himself; and they will therefore avoid
technicalities, while endeavouring at the
same time to present the facts with a
fidelity which will not, it is hoped, be
unacceptable to the specialist.</p>

<i>Early History and Methods of Casting.</i></h2>


<p class="noindent"><big>T</big>he origin of the bell as an instrument
of music is, one may almost say, lost
in antiquity. Its use is, moreover, widely
spread over the whole world. But I do
not propose to enlarge on its early history
here, or on its employment by all nations,
Christian or heathen. Space will not permit
me to do more than trace its history
and uses in the Christian Church, and more
particularly in the Church of England.</p>

<p>The word &#8220;bell&#8221; is said to be connected
with &#8220;bellow&#8221; and &#8220;bleat&#8221; and to refer to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
its sound; the later Latin writers call it,
among other names, <i>campana</i>, a word with
which we are familiar, not only as frequently
occurring in old bell inscriptions,
but as forming part of the word &#8220;Campanalogy,&#8221;
or the science of bell-ringing.
The French and Germans, again, call it
<i>cloche</i> and <i>glocke</i> respectively, the words
being the same as our &#8220;clock&#8221;; but that
is a later use, and they really mean &#8220;cloak,&#8221;
with reference to the shape of the bell, or
rather of the mould in which it is cast.
Modern bell-founders, it is interesting to
note, speak of the mould as the <i>cope</i>, which
again suggests a connection with the form
of a garment.</p>

<p>It is not known exactly when bells were
introduced into the Christian Church; but
it is certain that large bells of the form
with which we are familiar were not invented
until after some centuries of
Christianity. The small and often clandestine
congregations of the ages of
persecution needed no audible signal to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
call them together; but with the advent
of peaceful times, and the growth of the
congregations, some method of summons
doubtless came to be considered
necessary. Their invention is sometimes
ascribed to Paulinus, Bishop of Nola, in
Italy, about <small>A.D.</small> 400; sometimes to Pope
Sabinianus (<small>A.D.</small> 604), the successor of
Gregory the Great. At all events, from
the beginning of the seventh century
notices of bells of some size become
frequent. The Venerable Bede in 680
brought a bell from Italy to place in his
Abbey at Wearmouth, and mentions one as
being then used at Whitby Abbey. About
750, we read that Egbert, Archbishop of
York, ordered the priests to toll bells at the
appointed hours. Ingulphus, the chronicler
of Croyland Abbey, mentions that a peal
of seven bells was put up there in the
tenth century, and that there was not such
a harmonious peal in the whole of England;
which implies that rings of bells
were then common. If any doubt on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
matter still remained, it would be dispelled
by the existence to this day of some hundred
church towers dating from the Saxon
period, and evidently, by their size and
construction, intended to hold rings of
bells (Plate <a href="#Plate_1">1</a>).</p>

<p>I speak of &#8220;rings of bells&#8221;&mdash;and that
is a more correct term than &#8220;peal,&#8221; which
refers to the sound they make&mdash;but it
must be remembered that in those days
bells were not rung as in modern times.
At best they were &#8220;chimed,&#8221; i.e., sounded
without being rung up; but change-ringing,
which implies the full swinging round
of the bell through a complete circle, so that
the clapper strikes twice in each revolution,
was only introduced in the seventeenth
century, and moreover has always been
peculiar to this country.</p>

<p>Several ancient manuscripts have pictures
which throw light on the use of bells
in early times, as, for instance, one which
depicts a performer on a row of small
&#8220;hand-bells&#8221; suspended from an arch,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
which he strikes with a hammer (Plate
<a href="#Plate_2">2</a>). Another portrays King David engaged
in a similar act (<a href="#Frontispiece">Frontispiece</a>); and
others give representations of church towers
or turrets with bells hanging in them,
apparently without wheels or ringing arrangements
(Plate <a href="#Plate_3">3</a>). In the Bayeux
tapestry there is a representation of the
funeral of Edward the Confessor, in which
the corpse is accompanied by two boys,
each ringing a pair of hand-bells.</p>

</div>

<p>Ancient bells were invariably dedicated
with elaborate ceremonies, and were baptized
with the name of the saint or other
person after whom they were named (Plate
<a href="#Plate_4">4</a>). The bells at Croyland, just mentioned,
were named Pega, Bega, Turketyl,
Tatwin, Bartholomew, Betelin, and Guthlac.
There is, however, much disputing as to
the exact ceremonies employed, some
authorities maintaining that bells were
neither baptized nor even &#8220;washed,&#8221; but
merely blessed and consecrated, so as to
be set apart from all secular uses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>In the Norman and early Plantagenet
period the use of bells must have been
generally recognized. In London we hear
of one Alwoldus, a <i>campanarius</i> (1150),
which can only mean &#8220;bell-founder.&#8221; And
as early as the reign of Richard I the Guild
of Saddlers were granted the privilege of
ringing the bells of the Priory of S. Martin-le-Grand
on the occasion of their bi-weekly
masses in the church. The priory was also
entitled to claim the sum of 8<i>d.</i> for ringing
at the funeral of deceased members of
the Guild. Some of the bell-cotes of our
smaller parish churches, as at Northborough
in Northants and Manton, Rutland, appear
to date from the Norman period (Plate <a href="#Plate_5">5</a>).
In the twelfth century Prior Conrad
gave five large bells to Canterbury Cathedral,
and in 1050 there were seven at
Exeter; to ring the former no less than
sixty-three men were required!</p>

<p>But these are all mere historical records,
and it may be of more interest to know
whether any bells of this remote date still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
exist in England. With one or two exceptions,
bells did not begin to bear inscriptions
until the fourteenth century, and
even then we do not find dates upon them.
The only early-dated bells in England are
at Claughton, in Lancashire (1296), and
Cold Ashby, Northants (1317). There
are, however, here and there bells of a
peculiar shape which it is possible to assign
to a period previous to the fourteenth century.
They are long and cylindrical in
form, with hemispherical or square heads,
and usually very unpleasing in tone, as the
straight sides check vibration. One such
bell, formerly in Worcester Cathedral, and
now in the possession of Lord Amherst of
Hackney, must belong to the ring put up
by Bishop Blois in 1220 in honour of our
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> and His Mother. Even more remarkable
is a bell at Caversfield in Oxfordshire,
dedicated &#8220;in honour of S. Lawrence,&#8221;
a long inscription on the edge
showing that it was given by Hugh Gargate,
Lord of the Manor in the reign of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
King John (about 1210), and Sybilla his
wife. Such an inscription is very rare at
this early date; and it is interesting to
note that it is in plain Roman or Saxon
capital letters, whereas all the later inscribed
bells have what are known as
Gothic or Lombardic letters, which came
in about the end of the thirteenth century.
Most counties possess examples of these
long, narrow bells; they are specially
common in Shropshire and Northumberland.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The earliest bells were probably not
cast, but made of metal plates riveted
together, like the modern cow-bell. Not
a few bells of this kind have been unearthed
at different times, but they are all
mere hand-bells of very remote date, i.e.,
before the Norman Conquest, and the
process of casting must have been introduced
in very early times into England.</p>

<p>Bell-metal is a compound of copper and
tin, in varying proportions, but usually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
three to four parts of copper to one part
of tin. The former metal adds strength
and tenacity to the bell, the latter brings
out its tone. The popular superstition
that silver improves the tone of bells is
not only entirely baseless, but in point of
fact it has just the opposite effect! The
numerous stories which are current, of
silver being thrown into bells at their
casting, of which Great Tom of Lincoln
is an example, must therefore be discredited.
In recent years steel bells have
been made by one English firm, but they
are only one degree less objectionable than
the tubes of metal which are sometimes
also dignified by the name.</p>

<p>The process of casting a bell, as employed
both by ancient and modern founders, may
be described somewhat as follows:&mdash;The
first business is the construction of the
core, a hollow cone of brick somewhat
smaller than the inner diameter of the
intended bell, over which is plastered a
specially-prepared mixture of clay, bringing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
it up to the exact size and shape of the
interior of the bell. This was usually
modelled with the aid of a wooden &#8220;crook,&#8221;
something like a pair of compasses; but
is now done with an iron framework called
a &#8220;sweep,&#8221; which revolves on a pivot and
moulds the core by means of metal blades.
This clay mould is then baked hard by
means of a fire lighted within it. The
next stage was the construction of the
cope or outer casing of the mould, which
used to be also made in hard clay, its inner
surface following the <i>outer</i> shape and
dimensions of the bell. The &#8220;thickness&#8221;
of the bell itself, i.e., the part to be occupied
by the molten metal, was formed
in a friable composition which was laid
over the core and then destroyed. In
modern times the &#8220;thickness&#8221; has been
dispensed with, the cope being formed by
lining a casing of cast iron with clay shaped
to the external form and dimensions of the
bell. The mould is now complete, except
for providing for the cannons or metal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
loops which attach the bell to the stock,
and the loop to which the clapper is suspended
inside. Every care having been
taken to adjust the respective positions of
the cope and core with exactness, the
molten metal is then poured in through
an opening, and left to cool, after which
the bell comes out complete. The process
is analogous to that known as <i>cire perdu</i>,
employed by sculptors for the casting of
bronze statues. Illustrations of the moulding
processes are given in Plates <a href="#Plate_6">6</a>&ndash;<a href="#Plate_10">10</a>.</p>

<p>Inscriptions and ornaments are produced
in relief on the bell from stamps, also
in relief, which are pressed into the mould,
making a hollow impression in it. Copies
of coins were often produced in this way
by the older founders. Down to about
the end of the seventeenth century each
letter, or sometimes each word, was placed
on a separate <i>patera</i> or tablet of metal.
The usual place for the inscription is just
below the &#8220;shoulder&#8221;-angle; but modern
founders prefer the middle or &#8220;waist.&#8221;</p>

<p>A very interesting illustration of these
processes is given in the famous bell-founder&#8217;s
window in the north aisle of
York Minster, dating from the fourteenth
century, part of which is here reproduced.
The window is divided into three lights,
each having five compartments, and in
each light is a large principal subject surrounded
by ornamentation in the form of
bells, grotesque animals, and other devices,
with two rows of bells hanging in trefoil-headed
arches above. In the central compartment
of the middle light (Plate <a href="#Plate_13">13</a>)
the subject is the blessing by an archbishop
of the bell-founder, who kneels in a supplicating
attitude; in his hands is a scroll
inscribed with his name, <small>RICHARD TUNNOC</small>,
and under the canopy above the group
a bell is suspended.</p>

<p>The other two lights have as their main
subjects scenes from the actual processes
of bell-founding. In the left-hand light
(Plate <a href="#Plate_9">9</a>) we have the forming of the
inner mould or &#8220;core,&#8221; as already de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>scribed.
One figure is turning it with
a handle like that of a grindstone, while
another moulds the clay to its proper form
with a long crooked tool. The core rests
on two trestles, between the legs of which
two completed bells are seen; above are
a bell and a scroll with the founder&#8217;s name.
In the right-hand window (Plate <a href="#Plate_10">10</a>) are
three figures engaged in running the
molten metal, which is coloured red. The
metal is kept heated in the furnace by
means of bellows, worked by two boys,
while the chief workman watches the
molten stream running into the mould.</p>

<p>The next process, in the case of a
&#8220;ring&#8221; of bells, is the tuning which is
generally necessary, though sometimes the
founder is fortunate enough to turn out
what is known as a &#8220;maiden peal.&#8221; Formerly
this was done by chipping the inside
of the bell or cutting away the edge of the
lip. But it is now more effectively accomplished
by a vertical lathe, driven by steam.
The modern bell-founder can attain to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
much greater exactness in this respect,
because it is now recognized that there is
a regular ratio between the weight of a bell
and its diameter, and that a certain size or
weight implies a certain musical note.
Thus for a ring of eight in the key of F,
the weight of the tenor would be 14 cwt.,
and its diameter at the mouth reckoned
at 42 inches, the treble 5 cwt., and its
diameter 29 inches.</p>

<p>The frames are made separately, and
the bells hung on them in the tower with
their headstocks already attached<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>; until
recently all these fittings were made of
wood, and iron or brass were only used
for the smaller parts, but it is now the
custom of some founders to employ iron
frames, and even iron stocks, which may
be an improvement in lightness and stability,
or for ringing purposes, but are
hardly so in appearance.</p>

<i>The English Bell-founders</i></h2>


<p class="noindent"><big>I</big>n early mediaeval times it is probable
that bell-founding was largely the work
of the monastic orders. It was regarded
rather as a fine art than a trade, and ecclesiastics
seem to have vied in producing
the most ingenious and recondite Latin
rhyming verses to adorn their bells.
S. Dunstan, whose skill as a smith is
familiar to all, is known to have been
instrumental in hanging, if not in casting
bells; and at Canterbury he gave careful
directions for their correct use. S. Ethelwold,
Bishop of Winchester 963&ndash;984, cast
bells for Abingdon Abbey. In the museum
at York there is a mortar of bell-metal cast
by Friar William de Towthorpe, with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
date 1308 (Plate <a href="#Plate_11">11</a>); but this belongs to
later times, when a class of professional
founders had sprung up, and is therefore
exceptional. We read, however, of Sir
William Corvehill, a monk of Wenlock
Priory, who died shortly after its dissolution,
in 1546, that he &#8220;could make organs,
clocks, and chimes,&#8221; and was &#8220;a good bell-founder
and maker of the frames for bells.&#8221;
It has not been possible to trace his work
in any existing bells.</p>

</div>

<p>From time to time, however, we hear
of professional bell-founders, as they may
be termed, and even in the thirteenth century
foundries appear to have been started
in London, Bristol, Gloucester, and York.
The London &#8220;belleyeteres,&#8221; as they are
called, early attained a position of importance.
Many of them are mentioned in
contemporary records of the fourteenth
century; of others we have the existing
wills, which enable us to trace the succession
from one generation to another; and
again the names of several occur on bells<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
of this period, contrary to the usual mediaeval
practice. In the days when work for
the Church was a labour of love, less
importance was attached to self-advertisement;
though the student of the past may
regret this in some measure if it deprives
him of information he wishes to acquire.</p>

<p>The first London founders of note were
a family of the name of Wymbish, residing
in Aldgate, which was always the bell-founders&#8217;
quarter, as the still existing name
of Billiter (or Belleyetere) Street implies.
There were three Wymbishes&mdash;Richard,
Michael, and Walter&mdash;covering the period
1290&ndash;1310. Richard cast bells for the
neighbouring Priory of the Holy Trinity,
and has left his name at Goring, in Oxfordshire,
and on other bells in Essex, Kent,
Northants, and Suffolk; Michael cast five
bells still remaining in Bucks; and Walter,
one in Sussex. Other important founders
of this century are Peter de Weston,
William Revel, and William Burford.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
John and William Rufford, who may have
had their foundry at Bedford, were known
as &#8220;Royal bell-founders,&#8221; and placed upon
their bells the heads of the reigning King,
Edward III, and his consort, Philippa.
These stamps have a very curious history;
and were successively the property of
founders at King&#8217;s Lynn, Worcester, Leicester,
and Nottingham. At the latter
place they remained in use from about
1400 down to the end of the eighteenth
century; and their last appearance is in
1806, on a bell at Waltham Abbey, cast
by Briant of Hertford.</p>

<p>Between 1370 and 1385 there was a
founder in Kent whose name was Stephen
Norton; he used very richly-ornamented
letters, which may be seen on one of the
old bells of Worcester Cathedral, cast by
him when the tower was rebuilt. The
other principal foundries of this century
were at King&#8217;s Lynn, Gloucester, and
York.</p>

<p>The Gloucester foundry was successively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
in the hands of &#8220;Sandre of Gloucester&#8221;
(1300&ndash;1320) and &#8220;Master John of Gloucester&#8221;
(1340&ndash;1350). The latter&#8217;s reputation
apparently extended to East Anglia,
as in 1347 he was commissioned to cast
six new bells for the Cathedral at Ely,
which were conveyed thither from Northampton
by way of the Nene and Ouse.
The largest bell, called &#8220;<span class="smcap">Iesvs</span>,&#8221; weighed
nearly two tons, and the fourth was named
&#8220;Walsingham,&#8221; after the famous Prior
Alan who constructed the central octagon
of the cathedral.</p>

</div>

<p>Of the York founders, the most famous
is Richard Tunnoc, commemorated in the
remarkable &#8220;Bell-founder&#8217;s window&#8221; already
described (Plate <a href="#Plate_13">13</a>). He was M.P.
for the city in 1327, and died in 1330.
The names of other known founders of
this city extend from Johannes de Copgrave,
in 1150, down to the time of the
Reformation. A bell at Scawton, in the
North Riding, has been thought to be
the work of Copgrave, and, if so, is by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
far the earliest existing church bell in
England, if not in Europe.</p>

<p>In the fifteenth century (with which we
may include the whole period down to the
Reformation) the bell-foundries increase
not only in importance but in numbers;
and those already mentioned find rivals
springing up at Reading and Wokingham,
Exeter, Bristol, Leicester, Norwich, Nottingham,
Bury St. Edmunds, Salisbury, and
Worcester. The character of the inscriptions
now changes, and in most cases
(though not invariably) we find &#8220;black-letter
smalls,&#8221; with initial capitals, substituted
for the old Gothic capitals used
throughout. There is also a great increase
in the number and variety of the crosses
and other ornamental devices used by the
founders, and many introduce foundry-shields
or trade-marks, with quasi-heraldic
or punning devices.</p>

<p>The London foundries, however, still
maintain their place at the head of the
craft, and their bells are found all over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
England from Northumberland to Cornwall.
Two founders of the fifteenth century,
Henry Jordan and John Danyell,
whose date is about 1450&ndash;1470, cast
between them about two hundred bells
still existing. These are adorned with
some beautiful and ingenious devices, such
as an elegant cross surrounded by the
words <em class="fraktur">ihu merci ladi help</em> (Plate <a href="#Plate_14">14</a>) and
the Royal Arms surmounted by a crown.
Jordan&#8217;s foundry-shield bears, among other
devices, a bell and a laver-pot as symbolical
of his trade, and a dolphin with reference
to his membership of the Fishmongers&#8217;
Company. Another remarkable device
(Plate <a href="#Plate_14">14</a>) is that used by William Culverden
(1510&ndash;1523), with a rebus on his
name (<i>culver</i> = &#8220;pigeon&#8221;). Thomas
Bullisdon is remarkable as having cast a
ring of five bells for the Priory of
S. Bartholomew in Smithfield about 1510,
all of which still exist there.</p>

<p>To tell of the works of Roger Landen
of Wokingham, Robert Hendley of Glou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>cester,
John of Stafford (a Leicester
founder), Robert Norton of Exeter, or
the Brasyers of Norwich, would require
a volume. I can only note some interesting
features of their work. The Brasyers
seem to have been the most successful
workers outside London, and no less than
one hundred and fifty of their bells still
exist in Norfolk. Their trade-mark was
a shield with three bells and a crown,
which after the Reformation went to the
Leicester foundry, and some of their inscriptions,
in rhyming hexameters, are very
beautiful. A Bristol founder of about
1450 used for his mark a ship, the badge
of his native city. The Bury founders
were also gun-makers, and place on their
trade-mark a bell and a cannon, with the
crown and crossed arrows of S. Edmund.</p>

</div>

<p>Very few bells of this period are dated;
but we find examples at Worcester, perhaps
cast by the monks there, with the
dates 1480 and 1482; and at Thirsk
(1410), on a bell which is said to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
come from Fountains Abbey. There are
also some bells in Lincolnshire, dated 1423
and 1431, by an unknown founder, but
remarkable for the extraordinary beauty of
the lettering (Plate <a href="#Plate_36">36</a>). Dated mediaeval
bells are more commonly from foreign
sources, as at Baschurch, in Shropshire,
where is a Dutch bell by Jan van Venlo,
dated 1447, which is said to have come
from Valle Crucis Abbey. At Whalley
Abbey, in Lancashire, is a Belgian bell of
1537, by Peter van den Ghein, and at Duncton,
in Sussex, a French bell dated 1369.</p>

<p>The period of the Reformation, down
to about 1600, was, as has been said,
&#8220;a real bad time for bell-founders,&#8221; and
several of the important foundries, as at
Bristol, Gloucester, and elsewhere, appear
either to have been closed for a time or
died out altogether. The chief cause of
this was doubtless the dissolution of the
monasteries, coupled with the operations of
Edward VI&#8217;s commissioners, large numbers
of bells being sold or converted into secular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
property. These were distributed among
the parish churches, and many instances
may be traced of second-hand bells still
existing, as at Abberley, in Worcestershire,
where there is an ancient bell from
a Yorkshire monastery. It should also
be remembered that very little church-building
was done in the latter half of the
century. On the other hand, the statement
which has gained some currency,
that the commissioners only left one bell
in each parish church, is not borne out by
facts. Many churches still possess three
or even four mediaeval bells which must
have hung untouched in their towers
before and since the reign of Edward VI.</p>

<p>But this lapse in bell-founding was not
invariable; the foundries at Leicester, Nottingham,
Bury St. Edmunds, and Reading
actually seem to have received a new lease
of life, and 1560&ndash;1600 is almost their most
flourishing period. This is especially the
case at Leicester, where a well-known
family named Newcombe were at work,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
succeeded by an equally celebrated founder
named Hugh Watts, whose fine bells were
deservedly famous. At Nottingham we
have the dynasty of the Oldfields, lasting
from 1550 to 1710; and at Reading
a series of founders of different names,
ending in a succession of Knights down
to 1700. The Hatches of Ulcombe, in
Kent, were another prosperous family, as
were the Eldridges of Chertsey.</p>

<p>At Bury St. Edmunds, one Stephen
Tonne reigned from 1560 to 1580. His
foundry was, however, destined to yield
to the sway of that at Colchester, which
begins with Richard Bowler about 1590,
and reached its culmination between 1620
and 1640, under the great Miles Graye,
who has been called &#8220;the prince of bell-founders.&#8221;
Numbers of his bells remain
in Essex and Suffolk, his masterpiece being,
by common consent of ringers, the tenor
at Lavenham, in Suffolk. At Colchester,
as in other foundries, the seven years of
storm and stress&mdash;1642&ndash;1649&mdash;while the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
Civil War between Charles I and the
Parliament raged in England, practically
put an end to bell-founding. Siege and
other troubles certainly hastened the end
of old Miles Graye, who died in 1649,
worn out by privation and bodily suffering.
His grandson Miles kept on the
foundry until 1686.</p>

<p>Turning to the West of England, we
find the foundries at Bristol, Gloucester,
Worcester, and Salisbury still in a flourishing
condition. At Bristol George Purdue,
a native of Taunton, was followed by
Roger and William Purdue in the seventeenth
century; the latter migrated to
Salisbury about 1655, where he carried on
the work of John Wallis and John Danton.
Thomas Purdue, the last of the family,
died at Closworth, in Somerset, in 1711,
and on his tombstone are the words&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;<span class="smcap">Here lies a Bellfounder, honest and true,</span><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><span class="smcap">Until the Resurrection, named Purdue.</span>&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the West of England their place was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
filled by the Penningtons of Exeter, the
Evanses of Chepstow, and the Bilbies of
Chew-Stoke, Somerset. The Keenes of
Bedford and Woodstock, John Palmer of
Gloucester, and John Martin of Worcester,
all did good work in their day, as
did the Cliburys of Wellington, in Shropshire.
Another important Midland firm
was that of the Bagleys, of Chacomb, in
Northamptonshire, whose foundry was
opened in 1631, and flourished till the
end of the eighteenth century; though in
the latter period its owners became restless,
and settled temporarily in London, Witney,
and other places. In the North, York
was again the chief bell-founding centre,
and Samuel Smith and the Sellers were
famous exponents of the art; in the East
of England we have, besides Miles Graye,
first the Brends of Norwich, then John
Darbie of Ipswich, and Thomas Gardiner
of Sudbury.</p>

<p>Several founders between 1560 and
1700 were mere journeymen, who went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
about from place to place, doing jobs
where they could. Of such was Michael
Darbie, of whom it is said, &#8220;one specimen
of his casting seems to have been enough
for a neighbourhood.&#8221; At Blewbury, in
Berkshire, a local man attempted to recast
a bell in 1825. He failed twice, but was
then successful, and placed on his work
the appropriate motto, <i>Nil desperandum</i>.
Apart from this, it was not at all uncommon
for bells to be cast on the spot, as were
Great Tom of Lincoln and the great bell
of Canterbury, or at some convenient intermediate
place.</p>

<p>In 1684 a fresh start was given to the
Gloucester foundry, then fallen on bad
days, by Abraham Rudhall, perhaps the
most successful founder England has
known. He and his descendants cast
altogether 4,521 bells down to 1830, and
their fame spread all over the West of
England, from Cornwall to Lancashire,
and even over the seas. Most of the big
rings of bells in the West Midlands are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
their work. The foundry finally came to
an end in 1835, when the business was
bought up by Mears of London.</p>

<p>In London itself bell-founding seems
to have come almost to an end between
1530 and 1570. But about the latter
year arose one Robert Mot, who set on
foot what is now the oldest-established
business of any kind in England. The
foundry in the Whitechapel Road, now
only a short distance removed from its
original home, has always upheld its reputation
throughout the three hundred years
and more during which it has been continuously
worked. Several of Mot&#8217;s bells
still remain in London, and many others in
Kent and Essex (Plate <a href="#Plate_15">15</a>). In the seventeenth
century the foundry was in the
hands of Anthony and James Bartlet, who
cast many bells for Wren&#8217;s churches after
the Great Fire. In the eighteenth, under
Phelps, Lester, Pack, and Chapman, successively,
its reputation gradually increased,
and in 1783 began a dynasty of Mearses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
lasting down to 1870. The name is still
preserved by the firm of Mears and Stainbank,
though neither a Mears nor a Stainbank
now owns a share in the business.
An illustration of their bells is given
in Plate <a href="#Plate_16">16</a>.</p>

<p>Their great rivals of modern times, the
Taylors of Loughborough, cannot emulate
them in antiquity, though they can still
boast a respectable pedigree, dating from
Thomas Eayre of Kettering, in 1731.
After moving to S. Neots, Leicester, and
Oxford, the firm finally settled, about
1840, under John Taylor, at Loughborough,
where his grandsons now carry
on the business. Illustrations of their
bells are given in Plates <a href="#Plate_17">17</a>&ndash;<a href="#Plate_21">21</a>.</p>

<i>Big Bells; Carillons and Chimes;
Campaniles</i></h2>


<p class="noindent"><big>B</big>ells of exceptional size, styled in
Latin <i>Signa</i>, are no new invention
of the founder&#8217;s art. It speaks much for
the skill of the mediaeval craftsman that
he should have been able to cast giant
bells which not only rivalled the <i>chefs-d&#8217;oeuvre</i>
of our own day, but, as objects
of beauty, certainly surpassed them.</p>

<p>In the twelfth century a &#8220;tenor&#8221; was
added by Prior Wybert to Prior Conrad&#8217;s
great ring of five at Canterbury Cathedral,
which bell, it is said, took thirty-two men
to ring it. (This was achieved by placing
them on a plank fastened to a stock, by
which means it was set in motion.) It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
was, however, surpassed by another cast
in 1316, in memory of S. Thomas of
Canterbury. This weighed over 3½ tons,
but was broken in the fall of the campanile,
1382, and was replaced in 1459
by a slightly heavier bell, cast in London,
and dedicated in honour of S. Dunstan.
Its successor, a re-casting by Lester and
Pack of London, in 1762, stills hangs in
the south-west tower, and is used for the
clock and for tolling.</p>

<p>The cathedral of Exeter was furnished
with two bells which deserve the title of
great; but one, the tenor of the old ring
of seven, does not strictly come within the
limits of this chapter, which deals with
single bells. All these old bells had
names, some derived from their donors,
and the tenor was called Grandison, from
the bishop by whom it was given about
1360. Its successor, cast in 1902, by
Taylor of Loughborough, weighs about
3 tons (Plate <a href="#Plate_18">18</a>). The other, Great Peter
of Exeter, hangs in the north tower, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
was the gift of Bishop Peter (Courtenay)
in 1484. It has been twice re-cast, and the
present bell is the work of the Thomas Purdue
mentioned in the previous chapter,
dated 1676. The founder attempted to
preserve the old mediaeval inscription,</p>


<p class="center"><em class="fraktur"><big>Plebs patriæ plaudit dum petrum
plenius audit</big></em></p>

<p class="center smaller">&#8220;The people of the country applaud when they hear
Peter&#8217;s full sound,&#8221;</p>

<p class="noindent">but only found room for the first five
words. From the style of the inscription
we gather that it was originally cast at the
Exeter foundry. Its weight is given as
6¼ tons, but according to another estimate
is not more than four.</p>

<p>There is a rival &#8220;Great Peter&#8221; at
Gloucester, and here the original bell still
survives, the only mediaeval <i>signum</i> which
we still possess. It bears the inscription,</p>

<p class="center"><em class="fraktur"><big>Me fecit fieri conventus nomine petri</big></em></p>

<p class="center smaller">&#8220;The monastery had me made in Peter&#8217;s name,&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">together with two shields, one charged
with three bells, the other with the arms
of the abbey. It may have been cast by
the monks, as it bears no known foundry-stamps,
but the expression &#8220;had me
made&#8221; seems to imply otherwise. Its
weight is 2 tons 18 cwt. Yet another,
but a modern &#8220;Great Peter,&#8221; is that of
York Minster, cast in 1845, and weighing
12½ tons. It is the second largest church
bell in England.</p>

</div>

<p>From &#8220;Great Peters&#8221; we pass to &#8220;Great
Toms.&#8221; Of these there are two famous
examples, one at Lincoln Cathedral, the
other at Christ Church, Oxford. The
Lincoln Tom, which hangs in the central
tower of the cathedral, does not appear in
records before 1610, in which year it was
re-cast by Henry Oldfield of Nottingham,
and Robert Newcombe of Leicester. It
was cast in the minster yard, and weighed
4 tons 8 cwt. In course of time it was
found to be too heavy for the tower,
and was &#8220;clocked,&#8221; or tied down, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
a contemporary journalist describes it,
in 1802: &#8220;He has been chained and
riveted down, so that instead of the
full mouthful he hath been used to
send forth, he is enjoined in the future
merely to wag his tongue.&#8221; The result
was inevitable, and in 1827 &#8220;he&#8221; was
reported cracked, which led to his being
re-cast by Mears of Whitechapel in
1835.</p>

<p>Great Tom of Christ Church, which now
hangs in the tower over the gateway,
originally came to the newly-founded
&#8220;<span class="smcap">House of Christ</span>&#8221; from the despoiled
Abbey of Oseney. Six other bells were
brought with it, of which two still hang in
the &#8220;meat-safe&#8221; belfry. Antony à Wood,
the Oxford chronicler, tells us that it bore
the inscription:</p>


<p class="center smaller">IN THOMAE LAVDE RESONO BIMBOM SINE
FRAVDE</p>

<p class="center smaller">&#8220;In the praise of Thomas I sound &#8216;Bimbom&#8217; without
guile.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>Thrice unsuccessfully recast between
1612 and 1680, it is in its present
form the work of Christopher Hodson,
a London founder, who placed upon
it a long inscription beginning with
the words, <small>MAGNUS THOMAS</small> (&#8220;<i>Great
Tom</i>&#8221;). Oxonians will remember the
ringing of the bell every night at nine
o&#8217;clock.</p>

<p>Among other great bells of historical
interest we may mention that which hangs
in the south tower of Beverley Minster.
It survived from mediaeval times until so
recent a date as 1902, when it was re-cast
by Messrs. Taylor of Loughborough the
weight being no less than 7 tons (Plate <a href="#Plate_19">19</a>).
The old bell was probably cast at Leicester
about 1350, and bore some of the most
beautiful lettering ever designed by mediaeval
craftsmen (Plate <a href="#Plate_36">36</a>). Another of
Messrs. Taylor&#8217;s great works is the great
bell of Tong, in Shropshire (Plate <a href="#Plate_20">20</a>),
originally given by Sir Harry Vernon, in
1518, to be tolled &#8220;when any Vernon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
came to Tong.&#8221; It was recast in 1720,
and again in 1892, its present weight
being 2½ tons. It was dedicated to SS.
Mary and Bartholomew.</p>

<p>Another great mediaeval bell, only recently
recast, deserves mention here, though
strictly speaking, the tenor of a ring, and
not a <i>signum</i>. This is the magnificent
tenor at Brailes, in Warwickshire, richly
ornamented with shields, crowns, and other
devices, cast by John Bird of London,
about 1420. It bore a beautiful inscription
taken from an old Ascension Day
hymn. Greatly to the credit of the local
authorities, the inscription and ornaments
were exactly reproduced from the old
cracked bell on its successor, an admirable
piece of work executed in 1877 by
Messrs. Blews of Birmingham. The bell
weighs about 2 tons.</p>

<p>Among great modern bells the hour-bell
at Worcester Cathedral, cast by Taylor
in 1868, and weighing 4½ tons, deserves
special mention, as does a bell at Woburn,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
Bedfordshire, the work of Mears and
Stainbank of London, in 1867, weighing
nearly 3 tons. The former bears an inscription
taken from Ephesians v. 14, and
the letters used are copied from those on
the beautiful Lincolnshire fifteenth-century
bells mentioned in the previous chapter (p.
32). But the chief masterpiece of recent
founding is Messrs. Taylor&#8217;s &#8220;Great
Paul&#8221; at S. Paul&#8217;s Cathedral, which
holds the reputation of the largest bell
in England (Plate <a href="#Plate_21">21</a>). It has, however,
a rival in the hour-bell of the same
cathedral, which has a more lengthy
history. There was once at Westminster
a famous bell known as &#8220;Great
Tom,&#8221; which hung in a clock-tower opposite
Westminster Town Hall, but was
removed to S. Paul&#8217;s at the end of the
seventeenth century. This bell was famous
for its connection with the story told of a
sentinel at Windsor Castle in the reign of
William III, who was accused of sleeping
at his post. He defended himself by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
stating that he had heard the Westminster
bell strike thirteen at midnight, and this
brought about his acquittal. Though the
truth of the story has often been doubted,
the striking thirteen is, mechanically, quite
possible. It is said that this bell was
originally given by Edward III in honour
of the Confessor. On the way to S. Paul&#8217;s
it was cracked by a fall, and eventually
it was recast by Richard Phelps,
of Whitechapel, in 1716 (Plate <a href="#Plate_22">22</a>).
It now hangs in the south-west tower,
and is used for striking the hour, and
for tolling at the death of various
great personages. Its weight is 5 tons
4 cwt.</p>

<p>Great Paul is the masterpiece of Messrs.
Taylor, &#8220;one of Loughborough&#8217;s glories,&#8221;
says Dr. Raven. It hangs in the same
tower, below Phelps&#8217; bell, and weighs
16 tons 14 cwt., the diameter at the
mouth being 9½ feet. It was cast in
1881, and simply bears the founders&#8217;
trade-mark and the words (said to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
been selected by Canon Liddon) from
1 Corinthians ix. 16:</p>

<p class="center smaller">VAE MIHI SI NON EVANGELISAVERO</p>

<p class="center smaller">&#8220;Woe unto me if I preach not the Gospel.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is used for a few minutes before Sunday
services, and at certain other times.</p>

<p>A description of S. Paul&#8217;s bells is hardly
complete without an allusion to the great
ring of twelve cast by Taylor in 1877, and
placed in the north-west tower, the tenor
weighing over 3 tons. They were given
by the City Companies and the late
Baroness Burdett-Coutts. In addition
there are a &#8220;service bell,&#8221; cast in 1700,
and two quarter-bells of 1717 for the
clock.</p>

<p>Among other great London bells are
the ring of ten at the Imperial Institute,
cast by Taylor in 1887, and the tenors of
the rings at Southwark Cathedral, S. Mary-le-Bow,
S. Michael, Cornhill, S. Giles,
Cripplegate, and other famous towers;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
those mentioned are all from rings of
twelve, and weigh 2 tons or more.</p>

<p>The old campanile at Westminster, built
by Edward III, originally contained three
&#8220;great bells&#8221;; it was pulled down in
1698, and we have followed the history
of one of these bells, but the others disappeared.
They had no successor until
1856, when the late Lord Grimthorpe
(then Mr. Denison), an enthusiast for
clocks and bells, designed a great bell for
the clock tower of the Houses of Parliament.
It was called &#8220;Big Ben,&#8221; either
after Sir Benjamin Hall, who was then
First Commissioner of Works, or after a
noted boxer of the time named Benjamin
Brain. Its original founders were Messrs.
Warner of London, but being sounded in
Palace Yard with a hammer, for the amusement
of the public before being hung, it
was very soon cracked. In 1857 a new bell
was cast by George Mears of Whitechapel,
from an improved design, and
containing less metal. Its weight is given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
at 13½ tons. Shortly after its casting Big
Ben gave way, but after being quarter-turned,
could be once more utilized for
striking the hours. Its tone, however, is
anything but satisfactory, and one is forced
to the opinion that these excessively large
bells, very difficult to cast and awkward to
manipulate, are apt to prove great mistakes.</p>


<p class="center p1"><span class="smcap">Chimes</span></p>

<p>Sets of chimes, or arrangements for playing
tunes on bells, existed in England even
in mediaeval days; but they are nowadays
regarded as a speciality of Belgium, and
the famous carillons of Antwerp, Bruges,
and Mechlin are well known to many a
traveller. But it is not our province to
speak of these, and it may be of some
interest to see what use has been made
of such arrangements in England.</p>

<p>Dr. Raven, in his fascinating book, <i>The
Bells of England</i>, tells us that the machinery
of the carillon was a recognized thing in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
the middle of the fifteenth century, and
quotes from the will of John Baret of
Bury St. Edmunds, who died in 1463,
and gave directions for the playing of a
<i>Requiem aeternum</i> for his dirge at noon
for thirty days after his death, and on
each &#8220;mind-day,&#8221; or anniversary, to be
continued during the octave. The sexton
was also to &#8220;take heed to the chimes and
wind up the pegs and the plummets&#8221; as
required. The music of this <i>Requiem</i>, we
are told, only compassed five notes, and
must have been somewhat wearisome to
the good people of Bury. In old churchwardens&#8217;
accounts, as at Ludlow or Warwick,
we find frequent references to the
repair or upkeep of the chimes.</p>

<p>The principle of the carillon is similar
to that of a barrel-organ or musical-box,
implying a barrel or drum, set with pegs,
and set in motion by being connected with
the mechanism of the clock. The pegs, as
they turn, raise levers which pull wires in
connection with the hammers which strike<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
on the bells. With the ordinary eight
bells of an English belfry it is obvious
that only a limited choice of tunes within
the compass of an octave is possible, and
that they can only be played in one key
on single notes. The Belgian carillons
have sometimes forty or fifty bells in communication
with a key-board like that of
an organ, and tunes can therefore be played
on them in harmony. There are a few
carillons of this type in England, the best
known being at Boston, in Lincolnshire,
and at Cattistock, in Dorset, but usually
the ordinary bells are employed, as at
Worcester Cathedral and in many towns.</p>

<p>At the Reformation chimes largely died
out, but with the Restoration they revived,
and we hear of them at Cambridge,
Grantham, and elsewhere. Another kind
of chime which may here be mentioned is
that employed for striking the quarters for
the clock. Here, of course, no mechanism
is required beyond the connecting-wire
which raises the hammer and drops it on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
the bell. Of such chimes the best known
are the Cambridge Quarters, put up in
Great S. Mary&#8217;s Church in 1793. They
were composed by Dr. Jowett, the Regius
Professor of Laws, assisted by the composer
Crotch, who was then only eighteen.
The latter is said to have adapted a movement
in the opening symphony of Handel&#8217;s
&#8220;I know that my Redeemer liveth,&#8221; for
the purpose.</p>

<p>The practice sometimes adopted nowadays
of playing hymn tunes on bells by
means of ropes tied to the clappers is a
miserable substitute for the mechanical
contrivance. It not only causes agonies to
the musical ear by the unavoidable occurrence
of false notes, but is only too likely
to lead to the destruction of the bells altogether,
as the result of the &#8220;clocking,&#8221; of
which I shall have more to say later.</p>


<p class="center p1"><span class="smcap">Campaniles</span></p>

<p>We have seen that it is the normal rule
in England for bells to be placed in towers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
forming part of the structure of churches;
or rather it should be said that towers for
containing the bells were regarded as an
essential feature in the construction of a
church from the Saxon period onwards.
Over the greater part of the Continent the
same also holds good; but in Italy we find
detached bell-towers, or campaniles, to be
of frequent occurrence. The most familiar
examples in that country are the campanile
of S. Mark&#8217;s at Venice, and that built by
Giotto at Florence. There are many others
in Northern Italy, especially at Bologna,
and at Ravenna, where the churches are
of great antiquity.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Nor are such campaniles altogether unknown
in England. In mediaeval times
they were attached to several of our
cathedral churches, as, for instance, Old
S. Paul&#8217;s, Chichester, Salisbury, and Worcester.
The bells of Old S. Paul&#8217;s were
traditionally gambled away by Henry VIII
in 1534, and the campanile at Worcester<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
did not survive the Reformation; but that
at Salisbury, a most picturesque structure,
with a wooden upper storey and spire, was
wantonly destroyed in 1777 because the
bells were misused! That at Chichester
alone remains, a fine Perpendicular erection,
at the north-west angle of the
cathedral (Plate <a href="#Plate_24">24</a>). At King&#8217;s College,
Cambridge, a noble peal of five bells
hung in a low wooden belfry on the
north side of the chapel, which was
destroyed when the bells were sold and
melted down in 1754 (Plate <a href="#Plate_25">25</a>).</p>

<p>Detached towers are not uncommon
features of our parish churches in some
parts of England, particularly in Herefordshire
and Norfolk. The best examples
are at Berkeley, Gloucestershire; Ledbury,
Herefordshire; West Walton, Norfolk;
and Beccles, Suffolk. Some churches,
again, can only boast wooden detached
belfries of moderate height to hold their
bells, as at Pembridge in Herefordshire,
Brooklands in Kent, and East Bergholt in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
Suffolk (Plate <a href="#Plate_26">26</a>). The belfry at the last-named
place is no more than a mere shed,
and more than one story is told in explanation
of the absence of a tower to the
otherwise imposing church.</p>

<i>Change-Ringing</i></h2>


<p class="noindent"><big>O</big>ne of the chief uses made of church
bells in modern times is not strictly
a religious use, though it is more or less
associated with the Church&#8217;s seasons, particularly
with Sundays and Christmas Day.
But it has always been recognized that
the secular use of bells, within certain
limits, is permissible, as will be further
seen in the next chapter.</p>

<p>Change-ringing is, as we have already
noted, an entirely modern introduction,
and is, moreover, confined to England.
In pre-Reformation days we hear of guilds
of ringers, as, for instance, at Westminster
Abbey, in the reign of Henry III, where
the brethren of the guild appear to have
enjoyed their privileges since the time of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
Edward the Confessor. In smaller monastic
or collegiate establishments clerics in
minor orders were often entrusted with
the duty of ringing the bells, as at Tong,
in Shropshire (cf. Plate <a href="#Plate_30">30</a>). But this kind
of ringing was in no way scientific, nor
were the fittings of the bells adapted for
ringing in the strict modern sense.</p>

<p>The accompanying diagram (Plate <a href="#Plate_27">27</a>;
compare also Plate <a href="#Plate_28">28</a>), showing the way
in which a modern bell is hung, will
serve to explain the method now adopted
for ringing proper, as opposed to chiming.
The headstock, or wooden block to which
the top of the bell is firmly fixed (so that
the bell cannot move independently of it),
revolves by means of brass pivots, known
as the &#8220;gudgeons,&#8221; in a socket made in
the top of the framework. One of these
pivots forms the axle of a large wooden
wheel, half the circumference of which has
a groove for the rope, one end of which is
fixed in it, the other passing through a
pulley down into the ringing-chamber. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
mediaeval times half-wheels only were used,
but the complete wheel seems to have been
introduced by the fifteenth century, and
single bells were &#8220;rung&#8221; in the sixteenth.
Peal-ringing, as we know it, cannot be
traced before the seventeenth.</p>

<p>The essential feature of ringing in peal
is that the bell shall perform an almost
complete revolution each time the rope is
pulled, starting from an inverted position.
To prevent its falling over again at the
conclusion of the stroke, a vertical bar of
wood or iron, known as the &#8220;stay,&#8221; is
fixed to the side of the stock, which is
checked by a movable bar in the lower
part of the frame, called the &#8220;slider.&#8221; It
is clear that in the course of each revolution
the clapper will strike the side twice.
Before the invention of the wheel, the bell
was merely sounded by means of a lever connecting
the rope with the stock, as is still
done in ringing small bells, either as &#8220;ting-tangs,&#8221;
or when hung in an open turret.</p>

<p>Before the peal can be started, the bells<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
must be rung up or &#8220;raised&#8221; to the inverted
position, which the ringer achieves
by a series of steady strokes, each pull
increasing in length until it is balanced;
at the end of the peal this process is reversed.
When bells are merely chimed
they are not &#8220;raised,&#8221; but the rope is
pulled each time sufficiently to allow one
stroke of the clapper. By means of an
ingenious apparatus invented by the late
Canon Ellacombe, this can now be done by
one man if necessary, the muscular effort
required being reduced to a minimum.</p>

<p>But change-ringing is a real science, and
entails long and assiduous practice and considerable
muscular exertion. It is, in fact,
one of the best forms of physical exercise
conceivable, and must have proved a godsend
in that respect to many men whose
opportunities would otherwise be limited.</p>

<p>Its elementary principle is, of course,
that the bells should be rung in succession,
but in a varying order. The method in
which the succession varies is the founda<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>tion
of the various forms known vaguely
to most of us as Grandsire Triples, Treble
Bob-Major, and so on. They are founded
on a recognized arithmetical basis, that of
permutations, or the number of arrangements
possible of any given number of
objects. We know that three letters or
numbers can be arranged in six different
ways:</p>

<p class="center noindent">
123 132<br />
231 213<br />
312 321<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">Thus, on three bells, only six changes can
be rung so as to vary the order each time,
and we must then begin over again. With
four bells we have a choice of twenty-four
changes, which might run as follows:</p>

<p class="center noindent">
1234 3124 4321 4213<br />
2134 1324 4312 4231<br />
2314 1342 4132 2431<br />
2341 3142 1432 2413<br />
3241 3412 1423 2143<br />
3214 3421 4123 1243<br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">This method is known as &#8220;hunting the
treble up and down,&#8221; and was invented by
Fabian Stedman, a Cambridge printer, who
printed in 1667 the earliest treatise on
change-ringing. If the above table is carefully
observed, it will be seen that the first
bell, or treble, shifts its place by one each
time, backwards or forwards, while the
other three only change six times in all;
in other words, if the treble was omitted
it would be a peal of six changes on three
bells.</p>

</div>

<p>When we come to rings of five, six, or
eight bells, these changes are, of course,
capable of greater variety. On five bells
we may have 5 times 24, or 120 changes;
on six, 6 times 120, or 720; on eight
bells, 40,320; and so on. But in actual
practice it is very rare to have more than
five or six thousand rung, even if there
are eight or more bells; about 1,600
changes can be rung in the course of an
hour, and two to three hours&#8217; consecutive
work is as much as an ordinary ringer is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
capable of accomplishing. The essential
feature of each set of changes is to bring
the bells round to the order in which they
started; as they would naturally do in the
peal given above.</p>

<p>The result of the introduction of systematic
and organized change-ringing was
that companies or societies of ringers were
very soon formed. So early as 1603 we
hear of a company known as the &#8220;Scholars
of Cheapside,&#8221; formed in London. In
1637 was founded a famous London
Society, that of the &#8220;College Youths,&#8221;
probably a revival of the one just named;
its name is derived from some connection
with Sir Richard Whittington&#8217;s College of
the Holy Ghost, near Cannon Street. It
was to them that Stedman dedicated his
<i>Tintinnalogia</i>, the work already mentioned.
There is still an energetic &#8220;Ancient Society
of College Youths,&#8221; but it is not certain
whether it can trace an actual descent from
the older society. Another well-known
ringing society is that of the &#8220;Cumberland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
Youths,&#8221; originally &#8220;London Scholars,&#8221;
who changed their name in 1746 in compliment
to the victor of Culloden.</p>

<p>Before leaving the subject, may I venture
here a protest against the absurdities
perpetrated by the artists of Christmas
cards and illustrated magazines, in the
attempt to render the form of a bell and
the method in which it is rung? It is
certain that few can ever have visited either
belfry or ringing-chamber! Plate <a href="#Plate_29">29</a> gives
a more truthful rendering of the method
of ringing.</p>

<p>It may be fairly claimed as one of the
far-reaching effects of the Church Revival
that the conditions of our belfries and the
conduct of our ringers will compare very
favourably with what it was some forty or
fifty years ago. Where the more accessible
portions of the fabric were given over to
dirt and neglect, and slovenliness was the
chief feature of all ordinary forms of worship,
it was hardly surprising that the
towers and their internal arrangements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
were neglected, and frequently given over
to more secular uses.</p>

<p>Nor was this merely a result of the
general laxity and indifference of the
&#8220;dead&#8221; period in the Church. There
are not wanting signs that in the seventeenth
century the standard of discipline
among ringers was not high. We may
recall how John Bunyan, at one time an
enthusiastic member of the ringing company
of Elstow, was constrained to abandon
the pursuit, along with other enjoyments,
as not tending to edification. That conviviality
reigned in the belfry in those days
is shown by the use of ringers&#8217; jugs, some
of which still exist, in which large quantities
of beer were provided, and by the
frequent entries in parish accounts of
money spent on beer for the ringers.
One of the bells at Walsgrave, in Warwickshire
(dated 1702) has the inscription:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Hark do you hear?<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Our clappers want beer,&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>
<p class="noindent">evidently intended for a gentle hint that
the ringers suffered from thirst!</p>

</div>

<p>At the same time there was a feeling
that the actual ringing should be properly
carried out, which finds vent in the numerous
&#8220;Ringers&#8217; Rules,&#8221; mostly dating from
the eighteenth century, which may be seen
painted up on the walls of our belfries.
They all follow very much on one pattern,
and one of the best versions is at Tong,
in Shropshire, which may be given as an
example&mdash;</p>

<span class="i21"><span class="smcap">Geo. Harrison</span>, 1694.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is satisfactory to note that the rule
against swearing was very generally included,
though possibly honoured more
in the breach than the observance; but it
is probable that the objection to wearing a
hat was more on the grounds of inconvenience
to the ringers than of irreverence.</p>

<p>As late as 1857, the Rev. W. C. Lukis,
one of the earliest writers on church bells,
complained of his own county, Wiltshire,
that &#8220;there are sets of men who ring for
what they can get, which they consume in
drink; but there is very little love for the
science or its music; and alas! much
irreverence and profanation of the House
of <span class="smcap">God</span>. There is no &#8216;plucking at the
bells&#8217; for recreation and exercise. Church-ringers
with us have degenerated into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
mercenary performers. In more than one
parish where there are beautiful bells, I
was told that the village youths took no
interest whatever in bell-ringing, and had
no desire to enter upon change-ringing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Although less money is available nowadays
for payments to ringers on special
occasions, it may be feared that these
remarks still hold good to some extent.
But in other respects there is undoubted
improvement. We do not now hear of
&#8220;prize-ringing,&#8221; or ringing in celebration
of a victory in the Derby or in a
parliamentary election, and if our ringing-chambers
do not always reach a high
standard of decency, there is a marked
improvement in the character and behaviour
of the ringers themselves.</p>

<p>These lines will be familiar to readers
of Longfellow&#8217;s <i>Golden Legend</i>; but some
of the uses mentioned belong to a time
when bells were thought to have a magic
power over the forces of nature, and a
category of modern uses embraces many
others here ignored.</p>

<p>The modern uses of bells naturally fall
into two main divisions&mdash;religious and
secular, or quasi-religious uses. By the
former I mean the ringing of bells for
divine service, and, in particular, for the
festivals of the Church, and their use at
weddings, funerals, and other events of
life with which the Church is naturally
concerned. Other uses, again, though
now purely secular, had once a religious
meaning, such as the Curfew and Pancake
bells. More secular uses are those of the
Gleaning bell and the Fire bell, of bells
rung for local meetings or festivities, or in
commemoration of national events.</p>

<p>The only allusion to bells in our Prayer
Book is in the Preface, which directs that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
the minister &#8220;shall cause a bell to be
tolled thereunto a convenient time before
he begin, that the people may come to
hear <span class="smcap">God&#8217;s</span> Word, and to pray with him.&#8221;
This was, of course, the original purpose
for which bells were applied to an ecclesiastical
use, and by virtue of which they
are reckoned among the &#8220;Ornaments of
the Church.&#8221; It is, therefore, the rule
that every place of worship within the
realm of the Church should have at least
one bell, and in England at any rate there
are not more than half a dozen parishes
where the rule is ignored. The fifteenth
Canon similarly enjoins the ringing of a
bell on Wednesdays and Fridays for the
Litany.</p>

<p>Methods of ringing the bells for service
depend largely on the number of bells
available and the possibility of collecting
ringers together; and the ringing of peals
at these times is comparatively rare. Ordinarily,
where there are more than two, the
bells are chimed for periods varying from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
ten minutes to half an hour on Sundays,
while on week-days a single bell perforce
suffices, tolled haply by the parson himself.
In many places it is the custom to
toll the largest bell for the last few minutes
before service begins; this is known as the
&#8220;Sermon Bell,&#8221; and was originally meant to
indicate that a sermon would be preached.
Or the smallest bell is rung hurriedly, as
if to warn laggards, and this is called the
&#8220;ting-tang,&#8221; &#8220;priest&#8217;s,&#8221; or &#8220;parson&#8217;s&#8221;
bell. Some of these little bells bear the
appropriate inscription, &#8220;Come away make
no delay.&#8221; The use of a sermon bell is
said to date from before the Reformation.</p>

<p>In many parishes it used to be an invariable
custom to ring a single bell, or
chime several, at eight o&#8217;clock on Sunday
morning; this, however, has lost its original
significance since the general introduction
of early Celebrations. In former
times the regular hour for Mattins was at
eight, followed by Mass at the canonical
hour of nine, and though such an arrange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>ment
of services soon came to an end after
the Reformation, the bells which used to
announce them were continued even down
to the present day. There are still not
a few parishes where a bell is rung at nine
as well as at eight, even when there are
no early services.</p>

<p>In pre-Reformation days most churches
possessed, besides the regular &#8220;ring,&#8221;
several smaller bells, which are described
in inventories as &#8220;saunce&#8221; or &#8220;sanctus&#8221;
bells, &#8220;sacring bells,&#8221; and so on. Their
uses are sometimes confused nowadays,
but were clearly defined. The sanctus
bell, or saunce, usually hung in a turret
or cot on the gable over the chancel arch,
and was intended to announce the progress
of the service to those outside who could
not come to church. It was rung at that
point in the Sarum or English rites of the
Eucharist when the singing of the <i>Sanctus</i>
or &#8220;Holy, Holy, Holy,&#8221; just before the
Canon of the Mass, was reached; whence
its name. The sacring-bell, on the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
hand, was much smaller, and hung <i>inside</i>
the church, usually on the rood-screen.
It was rung at the end of the Consecration
Prayer, or &#8220;prayer of sacring&#8221; (Plate <a href="#Plate_30">30</a>),
and announced the completion of the act of
sacrifice. The Reformers made a dead set
against these practices, but it is difficult to
see that much superstition was involved
therein, and the revival in modern days of
the &#8220;sacring bell&#8221; in the form of a few
strokes at the time of the consecration
has more to recommend than to condemn
it.</p>

<p>A few sacring bells still exist, hanging
on rood-screens, in East Anglian churches,
as at Salhouse and Scarning (Plate <a href="#Plate_31">31</a>),
and one at Yelverton, in Norfolk, has just
been restored to its old position. Ancient
sanctus bells are more numerous, and a
few still hang in their original cots, as at
Wrington, in Somerset, and Idbury, in
Oxfordshire (Plate <a href="#Plate_32">32</a>). They have mostly
been fixed in the towers and used as &#8220;ting-tangs.&#8221;
The majority have no inscription<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
on them, but there are notable exceptions
in some of the Midland counties.</p>

<p>The only other &#8220;Sunday use&#8221; to which
I have to draw attention is the ringing of
a bell <i>after</i> services. This is, or was,
sometimes done with the object of notifying
a service in the afternoon; but it is
known in some places, as at Mistley, in
Essex, as the &#8220;Pudding Bell,&#8221; it being
supposed that it was intended to warn
housewives to get ready the Sunday dinner!
Some writers have thought that
this midday bell is really a survival of the
midday <i>Angelus</i>, or <i>Ave</i> bell; but it is
more likely to date from the bad times of
non-residence and irregular services.</p>

<p>The ringing of bells on festivals is more
particularly associated with Christmas and
the New Year, though the latter is a
secular rather than a religious occasion.
The Christmas bells have been a favourite
theme with poets, great and small, and
the best-known lines on the subject are
in Tennyson&#8217;s <i>In Memoriam</i>, said to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
been composed by him on hearing the
bells of Waltham Abbey, in Essex (Plate
<a href="#Plate_33">33</a>).</p>

<p>On New Year&#8217;s Eve the old year is
rung out and the new year in, in many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
parishes. Sometimes one bell only is
tolled until the clock strikes twelve, in
other cases the bells are rung muffled, i.e.,
with the clappers wrapped round to deaden
the sound, these being uncovered at midnight,
when a merry &#8220;open&#8221; peal bursts
forth. Either practice is to be preferred
to that of ringing consecutively before and
after the hour, which obscures the significance
of the performance.</p>

<p>A muffled peal is sometimes rung on
the Holy Innocents&#8217; Day, a custom said
to be kept up still in Herefordshire; and
in addition to the Greater Festivals, the
Epiphany, All Saints&#8217; Day, S. Andrew&#8217;s
Day, and S. Thomas&#8217;s Day, have been or
are still specially honoured. Ringing on
the last-named occasion, which is kept up
in several Warwickshire parishes, appears
to be associated with the distribution of
local charities. But ringing on &#8220;superstitious&#8221;
occasions, not mentioned in the
Book of Common Prayer, is forbidden by
the 88th Canon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>Another day of the Church&#8217;s year with
which bell-ringing is associated is Shrove
Tuesday, on which day the Pancake bell
is rung in some places at eleven o&#8217;clock.
Two bells are generally used, the sound of
which is supposed to resemble the word
&#8220;pancake.&#8221; The origin of the custom is
to be found in the calling of the faithful
to confess their sins and be &#8220;shriven&#8221; at
the beginning of the Lenten fast. That
pancakes were associated with this day is
due to the fact that butter was forbidden
during the whole of Lent. It was always
the Church&#8217;s rule that the bells should be
silent during that season&mdash;at least that
there should be no peal-ringing in Lent,
and no bells used at all during Holy
Week; and this is now generally observed.</p>

<p>Except in the case of royalty we seldom
now hear of bells being rung to usher
mankind into the world; but they have
always been associated with the rejoicings
of a wedding ceremony, and in some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
parts, as in Lincolnshire, are even rung
at the putting up of Banns. But their
use at the time of death is even more
universal.</p>

<p>The passing bell originally sounded as
a summons to the faithful to pray for a
soul just passing out of the world; but it
has now degenerated into a mere notice
that death has taken place, and as it is
rung (to suit the sexton&#8217;s convenience)
some hours after death, or even on the
following day, the name has ceased to be
appropriate. It appears to be one of the
oldest of all uses of bells, and is said to
have been rung for S. Hilda, of Whitby,
in 680. Unlike most other customs it
received the strong approval of the most
ardent reformers, and in the churchwardens&#8217;
accounts of the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries there are often long
lists given every year of money received
from parishioners &#8220;for the Knell.&#8221; The
sum paid was usually fourpence. The
67th Canon directs that the passing bell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
shall be tolled, &#8220;and the minister shall
not then slack to do his last duty.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the Knell is rung, it is a frequent
practice to indicate the age or sex of the
deceased. The former is done by tolling
a number of strokes answering to the
years of his or her life, or more vaguely
by using the largest bell for an adult and
a smaller for a child. Sex is sometimes
similarly indicated, but more usually by
what are known as &#8220;tellers,&#8221; a varying
number of strokes for male or female, and
sometimes also for a child. The commonest
form is three times three for male,
three times two for female; and sometimes
three times singly for a child; but
some parishes keep up curious variations
of this rule. The old saying &#8220;nine tailors
make a man&#8221; is really &#8220;nine tellers,&#8221; or
three times three.</p>

<p>The knell with the tellers is sometimes
repeated at funerals, but more frequently
the tenor bell is tolled at intervals of a
minute, becoming more rapid when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
corpse appears in sight. In some country
districts the bells are or used to be chimed
at this time, and in Shropshire this is
known as the &#8220;joy-bells,&#8221; or &#8220;ringing the
dead home.&#8221; In olden days a hand-bell
or &#8220;lych-bell&#8221; was rung before the corpse
on its way; this is still done at Oxford at
the funeral of any University official.</p>

<p>Bells were largely used in mediaeval
times to mark the hours of the day, even
before the introduction of clocks. In the
monastic establishments they were naturally
rung at the canonical hours of twelve,
three, six, and nine, for the services of
Mattins, Lauds, Prime, Tierce, Sext, None,
Vespers, and Compline. It has been
suggested that this is the reason why
chimes are usually played at these hours,
where there are carillons.</p>

<p>But one of the best known uses of bells
for this purpose is the Curfew, which was
often accompanied by a corresponding bell
in the early morning. We have usually
been taught that the Curfew or &#8220;cover-fire&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
was a tyrannical and unpopular
enactment by William the Conqueror, and
therefore a purely legal and secular institution.
There is, however, evidence that it
was in use long before at Oxford, where
King Alfred directed that it should be rung
every evening (as it is still); and William
probably only made use of an existing
custom for the beneficent purpose of
guarding against fires.</p>

</div>

<p>But it has also been suggested that the
Curfew was in its origin a bell with a
religious as well as a secular significance,
namely the Ave bell, or Angelus, which
was rung in the early morning and the
evening, usually at 9 a.m. and 5.30 p.m.,
and also at midday, and at the sound of
which every one was expected to repeat
the memorial of the Incarnation or &#8220;Hail
Mary.&#8221; Some have thought that bells
dedicated to the angel Gabriel were
specially devoted to such a purpose; but
this is doubtful, though the old Curfew
bell at S. Albans still bears such a dedica<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>tion.
At Mexborough, in Yorkshire, a
bell is rung morning, noon, and evening,
obviously a survival of the Angelus
bell.</p>

<p>The Curfew bell seems to have appealed
especially to poets, even to the American
Longfellow, and the puritan Milton, who
in <i>Il Penseroso</i> says:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Oft on a plat of rising ground<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I hear the far-off Curfew sound<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Over some wide-watered shore<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Swinging slow with sullen roar.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">Compare the opening line of Gray&#8217;s <i>Elegy</i>:</p>

<p>
&#8220;The curfew tolls the knell of parting day.&#8221;<br />
</p>

<p>The morning bell, whether an Ave bell
or not, is seldom now rung, but may be
heard at 5 a.m. at Ludlow, and at Nuneaton
and Coleshill in Warwickshire. One
of the old bells of S. Michael&#8217;s, Coventry,
now at S. John&#8217;s Church in that town, has
the inscription:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;I ring at six to let men know<br /></span>
<span class="i1">When to and from their work to go. 1675.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>
<p>The Curfew bell, though alas! growing
rapidly rarer, may be heard at 9 p.m. all
the year round in our two University
towns; and is also rung at eight at
Ludlow, Pershore, Shrewsbury, and in
Warwickshire. But it is now usually
confined to the winter months, from
Michaelmas to Lady Day, or an even
shorter period. In some places the day
of the month is tolled afterwards, as at
Cambridge; at Oxford 101 strokes are
given, representing the number of persons
on the foundation of Christ Church.</p>

<p>Of purely secular uses of bells space
forbids me to say much. The Gleaning
bell used to be rung in many parishes
during harvest, morning and evening, to
signify to the people when gleaning was
allowed. With the decay of agriculture
in England this use has almost died out,
especially in the midlands, but it is still
kept up in corn-growing parts, as in the
north of Essex.</p>

</div>

<p>Ringing has always been customary&mdash;at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
least since the Reformation&mdash;on secular
anniversaries, such as the birthday or
Coronation Day of the Sovereign, or on
the occasion of great victories. It was
also very common at one time on Restoration
Day (May 29th), and Gunpowder
Plot Day (November 5th), but&mdash;perhaps
since their removal from our Prayer Book&mdash;these
occasions are becoming more and
more ignored. Ringing on November
5th is, however, still common in Warwickshire.
Another day on which ringing
was often practised was that of the
parish feast, usually corresponding with
the patronal festival, or day on which
the original dedication of the church
was honoured.</p>

<p>It is or has been a tradition in some
places that in cases of fire the church bells
should be rung backwards; and elsewhere
a bell was specially devoted to this purpose.
At S. Mary&#8217;s, Warwick, there is a
small fire bell dated 1670, which, however,
is not now hung; and there is a well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>-known
one at Sherborne, in Dorset, dated
1653, with the inscription:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, quench the furious flame;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Arise, run, help, put out the same.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The large and small bells of the Guild
Chapel, Stratford-on-Avon, are also intended
to be rung in cases of fire.</p>

<p>The ringing of daily bells, especially at
night, is often accounted for by stories of
people who found their way when lost, or
were delivered from nocturnal dangers, by
hearing the bell of some church. Instances
of this are scattered all over the country,
and there are the Ashburnham bell at
Chelsea, the great bell of Tong in Shropshire,
and others which were originally
given in commemoration of such events,
with the object of keeping up the ringing
for the benefit of other wanderers.</p>

<i>The Decoration of Bells and their
Inscriptions</i></h2>


<p class="noindent"><big>M</big>ost of us are probably aware that
it is usual for bells to bear inscriptions,
be it only the date or name of the
maker; but few who have not actually
examined bells for themselves may have
discovered that they are often richly or
effectively decorated. We do not as a
rule find them as highly ornamented as
foreign bells, which often have every
available space covered with inscriptions,
figures and devices, or borders of ornament;
but to some the greater soberness
of the English method may seem preferable.
Nor is this practice of ornamenting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
bells confined to the more artistic age
before the Reformation. Some of our
most richly decorated bells belong to the
seventeenth century or even later (see
Plate <a href="#Plate_38">38</a>); and it is only the character of
the ornamentation which is changed.</p>

<p>In point of fact the earliest bells are
usually the plainest, and the mediaeval
craftsman contented himself with devoting
his skill to producing elegant and artistic
lettering, beautiful initial crosses, or ingenious
foundry marks (Plates <a href="#Plate_14">14</a>, <a href="#Plate_36">36</a>).
The latter were introduced about the
end of the fourteenth century, when, as
we have seen in an earlier chapter, the
guild of braziers or &#8220;belleyeteres&#8221; were
more regularly organized. Those used
by Henry Jordan (see page <a href="#Page_29">29</a>) are good
examples; as are the shields of the
Bury and Norwich foundries (page <a href="#Page_30">30</a>). In
the West and North of England such
devices are rarer; but badges, such as
the Bristol ship, or the Worcester &#8220;Royal
Heads,&#8221; take their place. One or two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
of the London founders use the symbols
of the four Evangelists (Plate <a href="#Plate_34">34</a>). A
favourite device is the merchant&#8217;s mark,
a kind of monogram, or the rebus, a
pictorial pun on the founder&#8217;s name.
John Tonne, who worked in Sussex and
Essex about 1520&ndash;1540, decorated his
bells in the French fashion, with large
florid crosses, busts and figures, and
other devices (Plate <a href="#Plate_35">35</a>).</p>

<p>Initial crosses are almost invariably found
on mediaeval bells, and their variety is endless,
from the plainest form of Greek
cross to the elaborate specimen shown on
Plate <a href="#Plate_36">36</a>, which is found in the Midland
counties. The words were frequently
divided by stops, varying from a simple
row of three dots &#10247; to such devices as a
wheel, a rosette, or an ornamented oblong
panel. Impressions from coins pressed
into the mould are by no means uncommon.</p>

<p>But often the chief or sole beauty of a
mediaeval bell is its lettering. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
fourteenth century this is invariably composed
of capital letters throughout, of
the ornamental form known as Gothic or
Lombardic (Plate <a href="#Plate_36">36</a>). Towards the end
of that century the black-letter text used
in manuscripts was introduced into other
branches of art, such as brasses, and thus
also makes its appearance on bells. But
the initial letter of each word is still
executed in the old Gothic capitals, and
such inscriptions are known as &#8220;Mixed
Gothic&#8221; (Plate <a href="#Plate_37">37</a>), later ones of the sixteenth
century being more strictly styled
&#8220;black-letter,&#8221; where no capitals are used.
The change, however, was not universal,
and many of the foundries in the West
and North of England preferred to adhere
to the capitals down to the Reformation;
while even in London, as at Leicester,
Reading, and elsewhere, there was a distinct
revival of inscriptions in capitals
during the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>The reign of Queen Elizabeth is usually
regarded as a period of transition, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
there was, before the general introduction
of modern Roman lettering, a time when
no general rule was observed. Some
founders used Gothic capitals; others
black-letter; others again, nondescript
ornate capitals difficult to classify; while
the Roman lettering, introduced about
1560&ndash;70, gradually ousted all the older
styles from favour, and with very few
exceptions became general about 1620.
The use of older lettering and stamps by
many founders during this &#8220;transition&#8221;
period is noteworthy. The Leicester
founders were especially addicted to this
practice, and among other old stamps
bought up the beautiful lettering and
ornaments used by the Brasyers, of Norwich,
in the fifteenth century. Henry
Oldfield of Nottingham (1580&ndash;1620), and
Robert Mot of London (1575&ndash;1608), may
also be mentioned under this head.</p>

<p>I have said that seventeenth century bells
were often very richly decorated; and the
ornamental running borders or elaborate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
arabesque patterns which separate the
words of the inscriptions or surround
the upper and lower edges of the bells,
surpass in that respect anything attempted
in mediaeval times (Plate <a href="#Plate_38">38</a>). Thomas
Hancox of Walsall (1620&ndash;1640) adorned
his bells with reproductions of mediaeval
seals; and as late as the beginning of the
eighteenth century the Cors of Aldbourne,
in Wiltshire, bought up a lot of pieces of
old brass ornaments from which they used
to decorate their bells. At Malmesbury
and Tisbury in that county they have left
bells covered with figures of cherubs, coats
of arms and monograms, a medallion of
the Adoration of the Wise Men, and
other curious ornaments. Most of these
founders, such as John Martin of Worcester,
Oldfield of Nottingham, and
Clibury of Wellington, used trade-marks
with their initials, and a bell or other
device.</p>

<p>Seventeenth-century Roman lettering,
although plain, is often most effective and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
artistic; capitals are almost always used
throughout, and small Roman letters are
very rare. It is not until the middle of
the next century that it was replaced by
the dull mechanical printing types which
are characteristic of the present day. But
since the Gothic revival several modern
founders have re-introduced capital letters
of the old style with good effect; notably
the Taylors of Loughborough. Nowadays,
however, there is little attempt at
ornamenting bells; not only the usual
inscription-band on the shoulder, but the
whole surface of the bell is utilized for
immortalizing local officials and celebrities.
On a bell recently cast for a church on the
outskirts of London are given the names,
not only of the Vicar, Bishop, and Archbishop,
but of the Prime Minister, Member
of Parliament, and Chairman of the District
Council!</p>

<p>So far little has been said about the
inscriptions placed on bells; but as these
form one of the most interesting features<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
of the subject, they demand some little
attention.</p>

<p>The earliest inscriptions, those of the
fourteenth century, were usually in Latin,
and very simple in form. We find merely
a name such as <small>IESVS</small> or <small>IOHANNES</small>, or such
phrases as <small>CAMPANA BEATI PAVLI</small>, &#8220;the
bell of blessed Paul,&#8221; or <small>IN HONORE SANCTI
LAURENCII</small>, &#8220;in honour of Saint Lawrence.&#8221;
More rarely, the founder&#8217;s name, as&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
<em class="fraktur">MICHAEL DE VVYMBIS ME
FECIT</em>
</p>
<p class="center smaller">
&#8220;Michael de Wymbis made me.&#8221;<br />
</p>
<p class="center">
<em class="fraktur">ION ME YEYT</em>
</p>
<p class="center smaller">
&#8220;John cast me.&#8221;<br />
</p>

<p>Other forms of inscription soon became
common, especially the simple invocation
to a saint&mdash;</p>

<p class="center smaller">
&#8220;Sancte Petre (or &#8216;Sancta Katerina&#8217;) ora pro nobis.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Saint Peter,&#8221; or &#8220;Saint Katherine, pray for us.&#8221;<br />
</p>

<p>By one founder, whose theology was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
somewhat confused, the Holy Trinity
itself was similarly invoked&mdash;</p>

<p class="center smaller">
&#8220;Sancta Trinitas ora pro nobis.&#8221;<br />
</p>

<p>He should have said &#8220;miserere nobis,&#8221;
&#8220;have mercy upon us,&#8221; as in our Litany.</p>

<p>What are known as &#8220;leonines,&#8221; or
rhyming hexameter verses, are also very
popular, such as&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><em class="fraktur">IN MULTIS ANNIS RESONET

<p class="center smaller">&#8220;For many years let the bell of John resound.&#8221;</p>

<p class="center"><em class="fraktur">VIRGINIS EGREGIE VOCOR

<p class="center smaller">&#8220;I am called the bell of Mary the excellent Virgin.&#8221;</p>

KATERINA VOCATA</em></p>

<p class="center smaller">&#8220;I am the rose of the world, when struck, called
Katherine.&#8221;</p>

<p>Most frequent of all is the Angelic
salutation (<i>S. Luke</i> i. 28):</p>

<p class="center"><em class="fraktur">AVE MARIA GRACIA PLENA
DOMINUS TECUM</em></p>

<p class="noindent">sometimes found in an English form as&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><em class="fraktur">&#8220;HAIL MARY FUL OF GRAS&#8221;</em>

(&#8220;Full of grace&#8221;).</p>

<p>There are said to be altogether seventy
different forms of dedication to the Blessed
Virgin. She is by far the favourite saint
with bell-founders, though S. Katherine
(possibly on account of her emblem the
wheel) was their special patron. On the
whole the dedications correspond fairly to
those favoured for churches; but we note
that S. Andrew, S. James, and S. Paul,
are rarely found, whereas S. Anne and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
S. Gabriel are more common. We must
not expect to find bells necessarily dedicated
to the patron saints of their churches;
it is in fact exceptional, and possibly the
name was determined by that of some
guild or chantry. Where they are the
same it is usually the tenor; but the old
ring of five at S. Bartholomew, Smithfield,
has the treble dedicated to that saint.</p>

<p>Among texts of scripture are also found</p>

<p class="center smaller">
SIT NOMEN DOMINI BENEDICTUM<br />
&#8220;Blessed be the Name of the Lord&#8221; (<i>Job</i> i. 21).<br />
<br />
IESVS NAZARENVS REX IVDEORVM<br />
&#8220;Jesus of Nazareth the King of the Jews&#8221;<br />
(<i>S. John</i> xix. 19).<br />
<br />
BEATVS VENTER QVI TE PORTAVIT<br />
&#8220;Blessed is the womb that bare thee&#8221; (<i>S. Luke</i> xi. 27).<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">But such texts become commoner in the
seventeenth century. An early post-Reformation
example is at Hannington,
Northants:</p>

<p class="center smaller">
LOVE HORTETH NOT (<i>Rom.</i> xiii. 10).<br />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p>Sometimes a bell bears a prayer for its
donor, or for his soul, as at Goring,
Oxfordshire&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><em class="fraktur">ORATE PRO PETRO
EXONIENSE EPISCOPO,</em></p>

<p class="center smaller">&#8220;Pray for Peter, Bishop of Exeter.&#8221;</p>

<p class="noindent">This was Peter Quivil, Bishop about 1290.
Or at Bolton-in-Craven, Yorkshire&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><em class="fraktur">Sc&#8217;e Paule, ora pro a&#8217;i&#8217;abus Henrici

<p class="center smaller">&#8220;St. Paul, pray for the souls of Henry Pudsey and
Margaret his wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>In these cases we are enabled to gain a
clue to the date of the bell, a piece of information
rarely found given in mediaeval
times. Henry Pudsey, for instance, died
about 1510. There is an interesting bell at
Aldbourne, in Wiltshire, dated 1516, with
a prayer for the souls of Richard Goddard
of Upham, his two wives and his children.
It is said that this is the only known
record of his double marriage, though the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
family is an old one, well known in those
parts.</p>

<p>English inscriptions are very rare, but
when found are often very quaint, as at
Snowshill, in Gloucestershire&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;<em class="fraktur">IN NAME OF TRINITE;
GILLIS</em> [Giles&#8217;] <em class="fraktur">BELLE MEN

<p class="center">&#8220;<em class="fraktur">JESU FOR YI MODIR</em> [the
Mother&#8217;s] <em class="fraktur">SAKE
SAVE AL YE SAULS THAT ME
GART MAKE</em> [had made] <em class="fraktur">AMEN</em>.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Reformation brought about a great,
though not an immediate but gradual,
change in the character of bell inscriptions.
We often find about this time the whole
or a portion of the alphabet; and it has
been supposed that the founder wished to
use his old stamps, but was afraid of
giving offence by adhering to the old style
of inscription, and so arranged the letters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
in a fashion to which none could object!
But right through the Reformation period,
the reign of Elizabeth, and the ensuing
Stuart period, it is by no means rare to
find the old formulae repeated. It is
possible that ignorant founders reproduced
them when recasting bells, without realizing
their meaning, or that they trusted to
the inaccessibility of belfries, not to be
found out! Still the fact remains, not
only that more &#8220;Popish&#8221; inscriptions
were left intact by Reformer and Puritan
on bells than on any other part of the
fabric of churches, but also that prejudice
and fanaticism here seems to have played
a smaller part. Yet there are indications
of Protestant zeal on the part of some
seventeenth-century founders. Tobie
Norris of Stamford (1603&ndash;1626) is fond
of proclaiming&mdash;</p>

<p class="center smaller">NON SONO ANIMABVS MORTVORVM SED
AVRIBVS VIVENTIVM</p>

<p class="center smaller">&#8220;I sound not for the souls of the dead but for the
ears of the living&#8221;;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">and William Purdue of Bristol, in 1678,
perhaps with the fear of James II&#8217;s advent
to the throne before his eyes, gives vent
to the prayer:</p>

<p class="center smaller">LORD BY THY MIGHT KEEP US FROM
POOPE AND HYPOCRITE,</p>

<p class="noindent">at Stanley S. Leonard, Gloucestershire.</p>

</div>

<p>For the most part the inscriptions of
this period are, when not merely churchwardens&#8217;
names, coloured with a piety
which finds vent in quaint and homely
expressions, such as &#8220;<small>FEARE GOD</small>,&#8221; &#8220;<small>IESVS
BEE OVR SPEED</small>,&#8221; &#8220;<small>IN GOD IS MY HOPE</small>.&#8221;
They remind us of the bells of Rylstone,
in Yorkshire, of which Wordsworth
says:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;When the bells of Rylstone played<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Their Sabbath music&mdash;<i>God us ayde</i>&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Inscriptive legend, which I ween,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">May on those holy bells be seen.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He was, however, unfortunately misinformed,
as the true inscription (on one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
bell) was, &#8220;In <span class="smcap">God</span> is all.&#8221; Other attempts
are more ambitious, such as&mdash;</p>


<p class="center smaller">I AM A CRIER IN THE HOUSE OF GOD

<p class="noindent">at Witcomb, Gloucestershire (1630), or&mdash;</p>

<p class="center smaller">BE MECKE AND LOLY TO HEARE THE

<p class="noindent">at Chichester Cathedral (1587). Some of
these inscriptions are on bells by John
Wallis of Salisbury, of whom it has been
said, &#8220;If we estimate him by his works
he was a great man; and if we take
his laconic epigraphs as an index of his
heart, he was a trustful, thankful, religious
character.&#8221; They are, at all events,
characteristic of the sober and straightforward
piety of the days of George
Herbert and Bishop Andrewes. Three
more characteristic expressions of the
period are largely used by the Nottingham
founders:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<p>We pass from these to others of the

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>
<p class="noindent">was actually placed on a bell by a founder
who must have had the courage of his
convictions! It need hardly be pointed
out that the royal cause was just then at
the depth of unpopularity. The eight
bells of S. Helen&#8217;s, Worcester, bear the
names of Marlborough&#8217;s victories in
Queen Anne&#8217;s reign, with an appropriate
couplet in each case. Other bells, such
as the great bell of Glasgow Cathedral,
and the tenor of Stepney, London, record
their own history from mediaeval times

<p>It is one of the many debts that we owe
to the Church Revival of the last century
that such desecrations of our bells as
quoted above are now a thing of the
past. If our modern bells are often
very dull affairs as regards their decoration
or inscriptions, we can at least be
thankful that profanity and frivolity have
disappeared. Though as I have already
noted, a tendency to self-advertisement
is still too apparent, there has been a
great change in the last fifty years, and
the improvement in the choice of inscriptions
is most marked. Those to whom
such things are a concern have begun to
realize that a bell is a vehicle of history,
and that, therefore, its history should be
duly recorded and preserved. But what
is of far more importance, they have also
learned to look upon it as an instrument
destined for <span class="smcap">God&#8217;s</span> service&mdash;as one of the
&#8220;Ornaments of the Church&#8221;&mdash;and therefore
just as deserving of honour as any
other furniture of <span class="smcap">God&#8217;s</span> house.</p>

<i>The Care of Bells</i></h2>


<p class="noindent"><big>I</big>t has already been pointed out that
our bells deserve to be treated with
care and reverence as much as any other
part of the church fabric, because they not
only have their historic interest, but are
closely connected with our acts of worship
and religious rites. I wish, therefore, in
my concluding chapter, to offer a few
suggestions as to their proper treatment.
And when we speak of the bells in this
connection we must not forget the belfries
also.</p>

<p>Some fifty years ago the Rev. W. C.
Lukis, whom I have already had occasion
to quote, called attention to the disgraceful
condition of many Wiltshire belfries,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
in words which were by no means too
strong for the occasion. He pointed out
that the neglect of the bells not only led
to their becoming useless, but also endangered
the whole fabric of the tower,
and eventually did mischief to the parishioners
also, who either had to do without
their bells or pay for the repairs. Many
of the towers were in so dangerous a state
that the bells were forbidden to be rung,
and though this may have been partly due
to the vibration caused by change-ringing,
for which, of course, the towers were not
originally built, the evils were, in his
opinion, due much more to neglect on
the part of the churchwardens, who were
responsible for the care of the bells.</p>

<div class="caption">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Bell by John Tonne, a Founder of Henry VIII&#8217;s
time</span> (1520&ndash;1540). Ornamented in the French fashion.
(See page <a href="#Page_108">108</a>).</p></div>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Bells,&#8221; he says, &#8220;require very constant
attention to keep them in ringing
order.&#8221; Therefore it is not the use of
the bells, not even change-ringing of the
most violent description, which destroys
the bells and endangers the belfries; but
simply neglect or carelessness. It must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
be borne in mind that bells are enormously
heavy, and are yet required to move and
revolve with perfect ease, and to be hung
with perfect balance and adjustment of all
their parts. Any temporary or amateurish
repairs will probably end in doing more
harm than good; nor will an occasional
use of oil or new ropes supply all that is
wanted. Above all, the frame-work must
be kept clear of the walls of the tower, or
the vibration will inevitably destroy it.</p>

<p>There is another matter to which the
same writer calls attention, which, if not a
source of danger to the bells, may often be
so to those who visit them, and which in
any case is a disgrace to those who have
the House of <span class="smcap">God</span> in their care. I allude
to the condition of the staircases or ladders
by which the bells are approached. &#8220;Generally
speaking,&#8221; says Mr. Lukis, &#8220;the
dark, winding stone staircases (when they
have any) leading to them are dirty, worn,
and difficult to tread; and when you have
secured your footing, you suddenly come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
upon a huge heap of sticks, straws, feathers,
and other rubbish, the patient and laborious
work of indefatigable jackdaws. When
the towers have no stone staircases, the
bells have to be reached by a succession
of crazy ladders, planted on equally crazy
floors. Why should towers be so desecrated?
Are they not as much a portion
of the church as any other part?&#8221;</p>

<p>These words, at the time they were
written, were doubtless true of the majority
of belfries in the country; but I fear there
are still not a few of which the same may
be said. I have been into many a belfry,
in which, on raising the trap-door admitting
me to the bells, I have been forcibly convinced,
by the showers of accumulated
filth descending upon me, that they have
literally not been visited for years! In
justice it may be said that where proper
access to the bells exists this is seldom the
case. At the worst, the bottom of the
staircase is made the receptacle for brushes,
dust-pans, and candlesticks, or such-like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
necessary articles. But why should not
proper access be provided in <i>every</i> case?
Even the solitary tinkler in a small and
elevated turret sometimes requires attention;
and even if the casual visitor to
a belfry must not always expect to be
considered, it is surely reasonable that the
parish official whose duty it is to care for
the bells should not find obstacles placed
in the way of reaching them. There are
very few churches, not reckoning those
where the bells are hung outside, in which
a permanent ladder might not be fixed,
where there is no possibility of a staircase.
And this, whether of wood or iron, need
not be either an expensive or unsightly
object; but it should be stout and sound
if of wood, and always fixed firmly at top
and bottom.</p>

</div>

<p>I have said that, on the whole, the last
fifty years have seen a great improvement
in the treatment of bells and belfries; but
only so lately as 1897, a recent writer,
a keen ringer and expert in all relating to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
bells, had occasion to re-echo Mr. Lukis&#8217;
complaints. He points out, however, that
the Central Council of Ringers, then
recently formed, is doing excellent work
by its reports on bell-hanging and similar
matters.</p>

<p>Some of these remarks of Mr. A. H.
Cocks, in his great work on Buckinghamshire
bells, are so admirable and so instructive
that I cannot forbear to quote them.
He devotes himself to finding out the
reasons <i>why bells crack</i>; and his conclusion
is that such a thing <i>rarely happens except
from sheer neglect</i>. Further, that while the
sexton and ringers may be entrusted with
the actual care and use of the bells, the
real responsibility lies, in the first place,
with the incumbent of the parish, and, in
a lesser degree, with the churchwardens.
The incumbent, it should be remembered,
has the legal right of granting or refusing
access to the bells, and of saying when
they shall or shall not be rung.</p>

<p>&#8220;If all incumbents,&#8221; he says, &#8220;would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
remember that bell-hangings are <i>machines</i>,
even if not quite so complicated as a
steam-engine, and that all machines want
a <i>little</i> attention, the lamentable and disgraceful
state of many of the belfries
would cease; and we bell-hunters would
no longer get the almost stereotyped,
semi-apologetic statement, on making our
request for the key, &#8216;I&#8217;m afraid you will
find a great mess up there, but, to tell you
the truth, I have never been up to them.&#8217;&#8221;
As he aptly points out, ringers, who usually
visit towers where the bells are ringable
and everything in order, know little of
these neglected places; but it is the incumbent&#8217;s
duty to know what goes on
under his supposed charge; and if he
refuses, the authority of rural deans and
archdeacons should step in to arouse him
to his duty.</p>

<p>Let every incumbent, then, who &#8220;has
never been up,&#8221; determine to visit his
bells. He will doubtless find his trouble
repaid, if they bear interesting inscriptions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
or devices; and if he finds the attempt
attended by risk of life or limb, let him be
persuaded to renew worn steps or broken
ladder-rungs. If he finds the belfry or
staircase full of animal and vegetable rubbish,
let him take the simple but necessary
step of fixing wire-netting over the windows,
and cleanliness, once attained, should
be easily preserved.</p>

<p>And now as to the cracking of bells, and
how to prevent it. Bells may crack either
at the top, or &#8220;crown,&#8221; or at the rim, or
&#8220;sound-bow,&#8221; where the clapper strikes.
The former is usually due to defective
methods of hanging, which cannot be
explained without becoming too technical;
but the latter comes from a very simple
and avoidable cause. Moreover, a bell
cracked at the crown does not thereby lose
its tone, and may last for years in that
condition; but if cracked at the rim it is
immediately and hopelessly ruined. If,
again, the cannons, or metal loops by
which the bell hangs from the wooden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
stock, should be broken, the bell may be
kept sound by boring holes in the crown
and bolting it to the stock. But in making
this latter suggestion I do not wish to
commend&mdash;rather to protest against&mdash;the
practice of modern bell-founders, who do
this in all cases, instead of using cannons.
They are supported by the ringers, who
say it makes the bell swing more easily;
but it is a barbarous practice, and destroys
the whole appearance of the bell.</p>

<p>Of all dangers which beset our unfortunate
bells, by far the worst is the
objectionable, but only too common, practice
of &#8220;clocking,&#8221; as it is called. Against
this, no protests can be too strong. The
reason is a very simple one. &#8220;Clocking&#8221;
consists in tying the clapper to the rope in
order to make the bell sound more easily
and with little effort on the ringer&#8217;s part.
Now, this gives the clapper very little
play, and it strikes continually on one
place at very short intervals. This checks
vibration and prevents the effect of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
stroke from spreading, and is a sure cause
of cracking at the rim sooner or later.
Yet all over the country it is constantly
being done, and on a recent visit to Essex
it was my experience in tower after tower.
Worse than that, I found the bells in
several cases actually hung &#8220;dead,&#8221; the
stocks being fixed to the frames, so that
any swinging was impossible.</p>

<p>&#8220;Clocking&#8221; is, unfortunately, no new
practice, as we hear of it at Reading three
hundred years ago; but would that
modern churchwardens would take the
same view of it that the good Joseph
Carter, churchwarden of S. Lawrence and
bell-founder, did then. He got the vicar
to draft a resolution that, &#8220;Whereas there
was, through the slothfulness of the sexton
in times past, a kind of tolling the bell by
the clapper-rope, it was now forbidden and
taken away, and that the bell should be
tolled as in times past and not in any such
idle sort.&#8221; In London alone twenty-eight
large bells in the principal churches were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
cracked by &#8220;clocking&#8221; between 1820
and 1860.</p>

<p>Even the ordinary clock-hammer, striking
on the upper side of the rim of the
bell, often has the same effect; and for
the same reason. But in both cases there
is a remedy, if put in hand at once and
after consulting a good bell-hanger, namely,
that of &#8220;quarter-turning,&#8221; or turning the
bell round through one quarter of its
circumference, so that the clapper may
strike on a place at right angles to the old
one, if that has become worn.</p>

later period. (See pages <a href="#Page_106">106</a>, <a href="#Page_112">112</a>).</p></div>
</div>

<p>If, however, a bell has once become
hopelessly cracked, there is no remedy
but recasting into a new one; though it
is said that a cracked bell in Dorset was
successfully repaired by a Norwegian
artificer about fifteen years ago, and where
he has succeeded, others may yet. Nevertheless
it is only too common for bells to
be re-cast when there is no necessity.
Perhaps one bell is broken, or it is desired
to increase the number of the bells, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
founder, with a pardonable eye to business,
suggests that all the old bells should be
melted down, in order to have an entirely
new ring, guaranteed in tune with each
other. And thus disappears many an
interesting and valuable old bell, perfectly
sound and well-toned. It does not follow
that because a bell is old its tone is inferior
to a new one, or that it cannot be fitted
into a new ring. Rather, the contrary is
the case, and tone improves and mellows
with age.</p>

<p>But when all else fails, and re-casting is
absolutely unavoidable, let me plead that
some faithful record of the old bell may
be kept. At least the old inscription may
be preserved, as to their credit was often
done by the seventeenth-century founders,
on the new bell. This practice, I note, is
increasing, and deserves every commendation.
But there is an even more excellent
way. The inscription may be copied in
exact fac-simile on the new bell (with, of
course, an indication of the new date), as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
has been successfully done in many
instances, notably by Blews of Birmingham
on the old tenor at Brailes, Warwickshire,
and in other cases by Mears and
Stainbank and by Taylor (see Plate <a href="#Plate_19">19</a>).
Or, again, the inscription-band may be cut
out and kept in the church, or used as the
ring of a candelabrum. This has been done
at Chester-le-Street, in Durham; West
Bergholt, in Essex; and elsewhere. It at
least preserves what is of special interest
and beauty. Or, lastly, the old bell may be
kept in its entirety, as a relic of the past,
in some part of the church. This has
been done, to the great credit of the parish
authorities at Wingrave, in Bucks; Batcombe,
in Dorset; Barrow Gurney, in
Somerset; and Swyncombe, in Oxfordshire.
This may perhaps be a counsel
of perfection, as it entails the sacrifice of
the money allowed for the old metal;
but it is certainly the most praiseworthy
course, even if it is too much to expect
from a poor parish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p>I plead, therefore, in conclusion, first
for clean and accessible belfries; secondly
for orderly ringing-chambers; thirdly for
due care and attention to the bells and
their fittings; and last, but not least, for
the preservation of all old and interesting
bells, not only to earn the gratitude of the
casual antiquary, but to show that their
historic value, and the services they have
so long and faithfully rendered, receive
due appreciation.</p>
